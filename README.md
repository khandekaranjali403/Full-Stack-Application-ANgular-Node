# Angular 10 Node.js MySQL CRUD example

In this tutorial, I will show you how to build a full-stack (Angular 10 + Node.js + Express + MySQL) example with a CRUD Application. The back-end server uses Node.js + Express for REST APIs, front-end side is an Angular App with HTTPClient.

We will build a full-stack Tutorial Application in that:
- Tutorial has id, title, description, published status.
- User can create, retrieve, update, delete Tutorials.
- There is a search box for finding Tutorials by title.
